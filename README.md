# Sorting Algorithms Analysis
Analyzing efficiency of different sorting algorithm in terms of their time complexities.

The algorithms covered are as follows,  
•	Merge Sort  
•	Heap Sort  
•	Quick Sort (Using 3 median method)  
•	Insertion Sort  
•	Bubble Sort 

Each of these algorithm's worst case time complexities are as follows,  

| Algorithm  | Worst Case Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Merge Sort  | O(n log(n))  |
| Heap Sort  | O(n log(n))  |
| Quick Sort  | O(n^2)  |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n^2)  |
| Bubble Sort  | O(n^2) |
